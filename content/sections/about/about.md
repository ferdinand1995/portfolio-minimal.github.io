I’m an iOS Developer and Technology Consultant with over 8 years of experience building scalable, high-performance digital products. I specialize in crafting thoughtful mobile experiences that don’t just function well—but feel intuitive, seamless, and impactful.

My core expertise lies in iOS development, where I’ve designed and delivered production-grade applications using Swift and modern architectural patterns like MVI and modular SPM setups. I enjoy turning complex technical problems into clean, maintainable solutions that align with business goals and elevate user experience.

Currently working as a Technology Consultant at Deloitte, I contribute across the full stack within large-scale fintech and banking platforms. From building microservices with Java Spring to architecting micro-frontends in Next.js, I collaborate closely with cross-functional teams to deliver end-to-end solutions that are scalable, testable, and future-ready. Maintaining high engineering standards—such as 80%+ unit test coverage—is not just a requirement, but a mindset.

At my core, I’m a builder—driven by curiosity, guided by clean architecture principles, and motivated by creating technology that delivers real business value.
