#### Colophon

This website represents my personal portfolio and technical philosophy — focused on clarity, performance, and simplicity architecture.

## Foundation

The initial design was based on an open-source template created by Konstantin Ruge.  
The original structure & content has been significantly customized to align with my personal branding.

This website was built using Gatsby.js
Deployed via Github Pages.

I’m grateful to the open-source community for sharing high-quality resources that accelerate innovation and learning.
